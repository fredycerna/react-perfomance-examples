# React Performance Optimization Examples

This project provides examples of how to improve the performance of a React application using the following techniques:

- `React.memo`: to prevent unnecessary rendering of functional components.
- `useMemo`: to memoize the result of expensive calculations.
- `useCallback`: to memoize functions and avoid unnecessary re-creation of them.

## Available Examples

- **Memo**: Optimization examples using `React.memo`.
  - Initial state.
  - Final state.
- **UseMemo**: Optimization examples using `useMemo`.
  - Initial state.
  - Final state.
- **UseCallback**: Optimization examples using `useCallback`.
  - Initial state.
  - Final state.
